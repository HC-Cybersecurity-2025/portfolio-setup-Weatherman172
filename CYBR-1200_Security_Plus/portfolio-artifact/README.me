## Summary
For this artifact, I created a security observation report about weak passwords at Company A. The report explains how weak or reused passwords create a security vulnerability and increase the risk of unauthorized 
access. It also identifies possible threat actors who could exploit the issue and describes the potential impact on the organization. This artifact demonstrates my understanding of authentication, access control, 
vulnerabilities, and basic risk assessment concepts from Security+.
 
## Professional Relevance
This artifact relates to real cybersecurity work because identifying weak passwords is a common task in security assessments and audits. In real organizations, security professionals are responsible for finding
vulnerabilities and recommending improvements. Password security is a major part of protecting systems and sensitive data. 
 
## Capstone Connection
In my capstone project, I can build on this artifact by expanding it into a more detailed security improvement plan. This artifact provides a foundation for analyzing security risks and developing solutions, 
which are important skills for the capstone and future cybersecurity roles.
