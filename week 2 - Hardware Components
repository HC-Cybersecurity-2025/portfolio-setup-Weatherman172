The different RAM types include DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, VRAM, ECC RAM, and DDR. DRAM is a type of computer memory that provides temporary storage for data and programs that the CPU needs quickly. SRAM is a much more expensive type of 
memory that is faster ad more reliable. It uses flip-flops instead of capacitors to store data. SDRAM is a type of computer memory that is synchronized with the system bus. DDR is a type of synchronous dynamic
random-access memory widely used in computers and other electronic devices. VRAM is dedicated memory on a computer's GPU that stores data for graphics and video processing. ECC RAM is a type of computer memory 
that automatically detects and corrects internal data corruption.
The different storage types include HDD, SSD, NVMe SSD, SSHD, Optical discs, and Flash storage. HDD is a storage device that uses magnetic storgae to save and retrieve digital data. SSD is a storage 
device that uses flash memory to store data electronically. NVMe is a storage access and transport protocol for flash and next-generation solid-state drives. SSHD integrates traditional hard drive storage with a solid
-state drive. You get the capacity of a HDD and the speed of a SSD in one package. Optical drives use lasers to read from or write to data stored on optical discs. Flash storage uses flash memory chips to store data
without needing power to retain it.
