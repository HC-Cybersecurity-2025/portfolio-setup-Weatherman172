What did I learn about personal cyber attacks and defenses? I learned that personal cyber attacks come in many forms, such as phishing emails or texts and weak passwords. I leearned that the longer'
a password is, the more secure it is and it will take a hacker longer to figure it out. I also learned that risks don't just come from hackers but can happen from user mistakes, such as clicking links, reusing 
passwords, and oversharing on social media. I learned that using special characters in a password is a great defense against hackers. 
How will my personal practices change going forword? Going forword, I plan on making sure I don't reuse passwords and that I make a unique and more secure password for when I need to use one. I've already updated 
some of my passwords after learning how easy they are to hack. I also plan to be mindful of what links I open to be sure I that don't fall into a phishing scam.
