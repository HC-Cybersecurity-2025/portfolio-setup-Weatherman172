Do you know what location services are? No
What is a MAID? They said they didn't know
Are you aware of surveillance-based advertisers? Yes
Does your school monitor your actions and how do they use that information? Yes, and to try to monitor cheating or other negative actions.
I was surprised this person didnt know what location services are. I dont think this person has the best perceptions about privacy. I informed them with some privacy information that they didn't know.

This friend had a very good perception of privacy even though they had the wrong MAID definition. I informed them that MAID stands for Mobile Advertising ID when it comes to privacy.

Are you aware of surveillance-based advertisers? Yes
